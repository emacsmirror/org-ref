* Chapter 1: System Architecture

** Introduction

This chapter discusses system architecture components and how they interact.

** Core Components

The gls:cpu is the brain of the computer, working with gls:ram to execute
programs. Modern systems use multiple cores to improve performance.

The gls:compiler translates high-level code into machine instructions that
the gls:cpu can execute. The gls:parser validates code syntax before compilation.

** Data Management

A gls:database stores structured information accessed via gls:sql queries.
The gls:cache improves performance by storing frequently accessed data.

The gls:queue data structure manages task ordering in the system. gls:encryption
protects sensitive data at rest and in transit.

** Communication

Systems communicate through well-defined gls:interface using standardized
gls:protocol. The gls:api provides programmatic access to system functionality.

Web services use gls:http for communication, often with gls:rest architectural
patterns. Data is exchanged in formats like gls:json or gls:html.

** Performance Considerations

The gls:algorithm choice significantly impacts system performance. Efficient
use of gls:cache and minimizing gls:database queries are critical.

The gls:tcp protocol ensures reliable data transmission across networks.
Modern gls:server handle thousands of concurrent connections.
