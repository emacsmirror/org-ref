* Document Body

When we talk about a gls:computer, we usually mean a device with a gls:cpu
and some gls:ram. The gls:network allows multiple gls:computer devices to
communicate via well-defined gls:api.

A gls:tree, unlike a gls:computer, is a living organism that grows in nature.

** Using Acronyms

The glspl:cpu in modern computers are very fast. We often refer to glspl:api
when discussing software architecture. The Gls:ram in your system determines
how many applications you can run simultaneously.

** Alternative Forms

Using Gls:computer (capitalized) at the start of a sentence. Or glspl:tree
(plural) when referring to multiple instances.
