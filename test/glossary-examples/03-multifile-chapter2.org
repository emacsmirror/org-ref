* Chapter 2: Web Technologies

** Overview

This chapter explores web technologies and how they work together to create
modern web applications.

** Frontend Technologies

Web pages are built with gls:html for structure, gls:css for styling, and
JavaScript for interactivity. The gls:interface must be responsive and
user-friendly.

** Backend Architecture

The gls:server processes requests and manages application logic. The gls:api
exposes functionality to client applications following the gls:rest pattern.

Data is stored in a gls:database and accessed via gls:sql queries. The
gls:cache layer reduces gls:database load and improves response times.

** Communication Protocols

Web communication uses the gls:http protocol for data transfer. The gls:tcp
protocol underneath ensures reliable packet delivery.

Data exchange formats include gls:json for APIs and gls:html for web pages.
The gls:parser validates and processes incoming data.

** Processing Pipeline

When a request arrives, the gls:server executes the appropriate gls:algorithm
to process it. Results may be cached in the gls:cache for future requests.

The gls:queue manages background tasks and asynchronous processing. The
gls:compiler optimizes code for the gls:cpu architecture.

** Security

gls:encryption protects data in transit and at rest. The gls:protocol stack
includes security measures at multiple layers.

Access to the gls:database is controlled through the gls:api layer. The
gls:interface validates all user input before processing.

** Testing Across Files

When you hover over these links, the tooltips should work correctly even though
the definitions are in separate files that are included via #+INCLUDE directives.
