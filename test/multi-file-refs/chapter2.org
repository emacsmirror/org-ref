This chapter analyzes the concepts from the previous chapter.

** Cross-References to Chapter 1

Here we reference items from chapter1:
- See Figure ref:fig:sample-figure for a visualization
- The equation eqref:eq:important is fundamental
- Table ref:tab:data shows the experimental data
- See Section ref:sec:introduction for background
- Newton's law is shown in eqref:eq:theory

** Local Content

We also have our own figures in this chapter:

And we can reference our own local labels: ref:fig:another-figure

** Results

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:result}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation}

The quadratic formula in eqref:eq:result is well known.
